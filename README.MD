API Rest Service Testing Exercise
A good API service for testing purposes can be found here:
https://petstore.swagger.io

The task is to write a Java client that has one method:
getPetsByStatus(PetStatus peStatus).
and uses the following REST endpoint:
https://petstore.swagger.io/#/pet/findPetsByStatus

When you have done this, write a Cucumber BDD test that uses the method you created to get the JSON
response payload and validate how many pets have the status “available” and the name “doggie”.
Additional Notes:

The number of pets returned from the live service may vary, so it
doesn’t matter if the test actually passes, so long as the failure is
readable.

If for any reason the swagger service was down, please use the json
response file included with this pack and instead of a client that
calls a REST API make the client just read the file and return
contents as a JSON string. The test can then perform the same validation as described above.
As an additional challenge, provide a mocking service like Wiremock
to return the JSON payload instead of the live swagger service
controlled by a flag. (This is optional for this exercise)
Provide logging and readable test reports for this exercise.
